These codes will evaluate the amount of hydrophobic mismatch between a KALP protein and a DPPC lipid bilayer. We have designed the protein to have a hydrophobic depth equal to that of the bilayer.

The protein is called as KALP 23 ( K-Lysine , A-Alanine , L-leucine , 23 - number of amino acids in the helical hydrophobic section)

Please run the file - BilayerThickness_lop101_inner23 and BilayerThickness_lop101_outer23 . These codes will execute all the other dependent Matlab codes.
