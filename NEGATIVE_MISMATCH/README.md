These codes will evaluate the amount of hydrophobic mismatch between a KALP protein and a DPPC lipid bilayer.
We have designed the protein to have a shorter hydrophobic section as compared to the hydrop[hobic thickness of the bilayer.


The protein is called as KALP 19 ( K-Lysine , A-Alanine , L-leucine , 19 - number of amino acids in the helical hydrophobic section)
