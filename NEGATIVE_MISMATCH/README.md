These codes will evaluate the amount of hydrophobic mismatch between a KALP protein and a DPPC lipid bilayer.
We have designed the protein to have a shorter hydrophobic section ,as compared to the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer.


The protein is called as KALP 19 ( K-Lysine , A-Alanine , L-leucine , 19 - number of amino acids in the helical hydrophobic section)

Please run the file - BilayerThickness_lop101_inner19 and BilayerThickness_lop101_outer19 . These codes will execute all the other dependent Matlab codes.
