These codes will evaluate the amount of hydrophobic mismatch between a KALP protein and a DPPC lipid bilayer. We have designed the protein to have a longer hydrophobic section ,as compared to the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer.

The protein is called as KALP 27 ( K-Lysine , A-Alanine , L-leucine , 27 - number of amino acids in the helical hydrophobic section)

Please run the file - BilayerThickness_lop101_inner27 and BilayerThickness_lop101_outer27 . These codes will execute all the other dependent Matlab codes.
